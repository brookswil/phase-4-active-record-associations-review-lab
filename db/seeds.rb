# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# passenger1 = Passenger.create(name: "Brooks")
# passenger2 = Passenger.create(name: "Myckala")

# taxi1 = Taxi.create(name: "dopender")
# taxi2 = Taxi.create(name: "Jason")

# Ride.create(passenger_id: passenger1.id, taxi_id: taxi1.id)
# Ride.create(passenger_id: passenger2.id, taxi_id: taxi2.id)
